# The labyrinth

_You are stuck in a labyrinth. Oh no! There is unfortunately a minotaur chasing after you. Oh no! But... if you can find a text file hidden deep inside this labyrinth, they say that you can find the secret to escaping, and not only that, but also the secret to life and eternal youth!_

Our task is to find a text file buried in tons of directories and subdirectories. 

Simply use `find` which can recursively check directories for files.

Running `find . -name '*.txt'` gives us the location of the flag file.

Flag is flag{never_give_up}
