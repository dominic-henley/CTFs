# Cookies

As with most Web Exploitation challenges, I find that starting with burpsuite provides me with a lot of informataion to work with. Typing in random things into the search box resulted in this POST request.

Mostly standard stuff, one thing of note is the `Cookie: name=-1` header. Forwarding the request resulted in this on the webpage.

I found it unusual how it says it wasn't a valid cookie, so I tried typing in types of cookies (actual cookies) which resulted in different behavior.

Wasn't the value of `name` in the `Cookie` header -1 just now?

Perhaps there is a special cookie, which will show us the flag? I found it odd that the value of `name` is now 0, so I tried changing the value, and each time it resulted in a different type of cookie!

An easy way to test different payloads on burpsuite is to send the intercepted HTTP request to Intruder, then mark the part of the request we want to change with the payload and write the payload under the Payloads tab.

Going from the values 1 to 20, we find that cookie number 18 is special, and is also the flag!
