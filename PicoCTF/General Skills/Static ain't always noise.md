# Static ain't always noise

*Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help!*

Pretty simple challenge. Download the bash script and run it. Remember to change the script to an executable first 

`chmod +x ltdis.sh`

Then run the script and use the static file as input.

`flag:picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_f5aeda17}`
